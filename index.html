    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Geophysics Observer at BMKG (Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysics Agency of Indonesia) for six years
        with a degree in Physics, specializing in observing earthquakes and tsunamis. Awarded an LPDP scholarship (full
        scholarship) and
        currently pursuing a master’s degree in Information Technology at the University of Auckland.

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Hasanuddin University</strong> | Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia.</p>
            Bachelor of Science (S.Si) from Mathematics and Natural Sciences Faculty specializing in Theoretical and
            Computational Physics (GPA 3.3 out of 4).
        </li>


        <li>
            <p><strong>Auckland University</strong> | Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
            Master of Information Technology (M.InfoTech) from Faculty of Science specializing in Machine Learning.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Physics Tentor (2015 - 2016)</strong></li>
        <p>Tutored middle school (SMP) and high school (SMA) students in Physics, focusing on exam preparation,
            problem-solving skills, and personalized instruction to strengthen understanding of key concepts.
        </p>

        <li> <strong>Meteorological and Geophysical Observer (2018 - Present)</strong></li>
        <p>Working as a Geophysical Observer for the Manado Geophysical Station. In charge of analyzing waveform
            recording
            data from seismometers, observing crescent moons and eclipses, monitoring the inclination, declination, and
            magnitude
            of the Earth's magnetic field, and tracking daily temperature, visibility, wind speed, rainfall, lightning,
            and other
            essential variables for weather prediction. Took part in the waveform data analysis to collect aftershocks
            when large
            earthquakes occurred and caused tsunamis, such as the Palu tsunami in 2018. Have been participating in
            creating
            Tsunami Hazard Maps for several areas, including Bitung, Southeast Minahassa, and Manado.
        </p>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>Spatial Data: QGIS and ArcGIS.</li>
        <li>Geophysics: COMCOT, COMMIT, MICA, NexStorm, and SeisComP4.</li>
        <li>Information Technology: Microsoft Office, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Svelte, Node.JS, Express,
            and SQL.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Awards</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Winner of the Science and Technology Operational Meteorology,
                Climatology, and Geophysics Development Competition (BMKG) (2022) </strong>
        </li>
        <p>The program PCR (Parameter Chat’s Retriever) has been developed to automate the extraction of earthquake
            parameters from WhatsApp chats and convert them into a tabular format, specifically in Excel. This
            eliminates the
            need to transfer earthquake data from WhatsApp to Excel manually. This program makes creating earthquake
            coordinate plots (seismic maps) more accessible, and monitoring aftershock recapitulation following a major
            earthquake can be done more quickly. This competition is participated in by all BMKG (Meteorology,
            Climatology,
            and Geophysics Agency) employees in Indonesia, which ultimately leaves three winners from each field:
            Meteorology,
            Climatology, and Geophysics, and this program is among the winners in the Geophysics field.
        </p>

        <li><strong>Runner Up in the Provincial Physics Olympiad (MAN 1 Kotamobagu) (2011)</strong>
        </li>
        <p>
            Attained second position in the high school Physics Olympiad held at the provincial level. This competition
            is participated in by Madrasah Aliyah schools in North Sulawesi.
